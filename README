Pickling-tools C++ source code that can be packed into a debian package.

Pickling Tools (version 1.7.0):

This distribution contains tools to allow you to exchange information
between C++ and Python and Java.  You can either exchange data between systems
using files or sockets.

This set of tools is called "PicklingTools" because the clients and
servers talk to each other over sockets via tables that are "pickled":
Pickling is Python name for serialized data.
